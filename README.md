# Advent of Code

I'm pulling together all of my Advent of Code solutions over the years and filling in gaps. Maybe taking a second run at some years with a different language or new constraint. Just a puzzle repo for me to play with basically.

## 2023

All solutions solved with Typescript.

## 2015 - 2022

Vanilla JavaScript, I think

## Deploy

Clone the repo, and run the following to execute the solution for Day 1a:

```
npm install
npm start solutions/1a
```
